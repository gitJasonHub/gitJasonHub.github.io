<p> Oval occasions is a newer company that has been in the works for quite some time.  Founder and CEO, Jason Newquist, felt that this world needed something.  Something that the world was lacking and could benefit from.  From that thought process, Oval Occasions was born.  The business started off slower then Newquist expected it would go. In his own words he said: "Maybe I am lacking something in my planning or perhaps my product.  I don't understand why business isn't booming."  Business began to pick up after Newquist made a key purchase that would change the business forever.  Newquist purchased Gilbert park (see left picture) in Seattle to have something of his own.  The company, before it owned its venues, would rent the locations from the previous owners.  Newquist felt it was best to own the given locations.  In Newquist's own words he said: "I just felt the company needed something of its own.  Something we could call ours.  That way we could do what we liked with it."  Once Gilbert park seemed to be working out, Newquist and his business advisors got into the process of buying the venues and saving up until they could afford the next location.  After a few years of this, business began to pick up significantly.  In 2013, construction began on the Oval Occasions headquarters building(see right picture).  Business was a success and Newquist couldn't be happier with his accomplishments.
