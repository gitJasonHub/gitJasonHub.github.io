<p>Our beach venue is perfect for your summer getaway event.  This venue is located within 100 feet of the beach with an authentic Polynesian shelter to cover you from the hot sun.  The shelter can accommodate up to 50 people comfortably.  Our entertainment at this paradise include hula dancers, flame jugglers, and ukulele performances.  Our catering service for this location include mouthwatering dishes such as the traditional kalua pig luau, the savory lomilomi salmon, and our famous crab and lobster sea feast. </p>
