<p>Rooftop Venue</p>
<p> Our rooftop venue is perfect for an evening in the sky.  This venue provides a view over the city that is comparable to none else and provides an indoor seating area that doesnâ€™t steal the magnificent view.  The indoor seating area can hold 75 people comfortably.  Our entertainment at this height include bright and brilliant firework shows, pleasing classical bands, and a stunning stage performance.  Our catering service for this site include savory crepes, meatballs with pasta in a rich tomato sauce, and our world-famous surf and turf, steak and shrimp special.</p>
